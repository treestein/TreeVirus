# TreeVirus
This is the original TreeVirus code.
I made this when I was in grade 10-11 high school as a small
application to prank my friends and teachers.

There have since been more updated versions however I have lost
the source code for them.

This was one of my first fully "finished" applications I had
ever written so please excuse the absolute horrid code quality.
I have quickly gone through and cleaned and commented anything
that I can in an attempt to make this spaghetti code readable.

I managed to condense what was almost 300-400 lines of code to half 
that size.

### A word of warning.
Running the application should pose no serious risk to your computer.
I have seen different reactions to the program from different computers.
Some BSOD and some the application crashes after a certain time.

However, it should be noted that the application uses forever loops
and will not stop until one of those things happen. Are sure fire way
to terminate it is to have task manager open before you run it and
kill the process from there.
